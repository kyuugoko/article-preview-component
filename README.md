### What I learned

The way the ```window```target works and how the ```DOMCOntentnLoaded``` event fires everything cleanly became a must for this challenge. Didn't know about them but it really helped sorting the way how the toggles in my JS file were firing immediately upon going live.

`window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    classSwitch()
})`


### Continued development

First time implementing JavaScript, not a hard exercise to use it on butfor a first it was definitely a hurdle.
The SASS structure and organization needs refinement, but even more so the documentation aspect of the challenge.
